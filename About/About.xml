	<description>Version 0.9.2.1 - Beta
Rim War introduces global conquest where factions vie to become the dominant power across RimWorld.
    
Gone are the days of random bands of raider seeking only plunder and wanton destruction; factions are now in a race to exert their influence across the RimWorld through mobile armies, trade caravans, base settlement, and diplomacy. Arise from the ashes of your unfortunate circumstances and use all the assets at your disposal to become a powerful influence across the globe.

Armies (warbands and scouting parties), settlers, and caravans for all factions can now be seen on the world map and will have practical purposes, destinations, and associated events. Existing events such as raids, trader caravans and more are all generated by AI action and represented as an icon on the map. The more combat power a settlement has, the more difficult raids or wealthy caravans a faction settlement can generate.

Introduces a new winning condition to defeat a rival faction

Overall faction power is a composed of settlements, warbands, scouting parties, and settlers and the amount of faction power determines the size and strength of armies, caravans, and settlers that AI faction can generate. Defeating an enemy army, gifting, or trading with other factions directly affects their faction power. Faction interaction matters - form alliances, subjugate the weak, and destroy dangerous enemies across the world to create winning conditions.

Factions will interact with each other to form alliances or declare war. Take advantage of warring factions and strike while they are weak; or declare an alliance with a friendly factions to fight your wars for you.</description>
