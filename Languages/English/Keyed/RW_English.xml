<RW_randomizeFactionBehavior>Random Faction behavior</RW_randomizeFactionBehavior>
<RW_randomizeFactionBehaviorInfo>Core game factions have a pre-defined behavior - eg Outlander Civil will always have a Cautious behavior, Rough Tribes will always be warmonger's etc. Enabling this setting randomizes all faction behavior regardless of what's defined in the RimWarDef.xml file.</RW_randomizeFactionBehaviorInfo>
<RW_storytellerBasedDifficulty>RimWar difficulty uses game difficulty</RW_storytellerBasedDifficulty>
<RW_storytellerBasedDifficultyInfo>This option associates bonus points for RimWar actions with the game difficulty. Higher difficulty increases rate of growth, raid sizes, etc. Disabling this allows you to make Rim War actions more or less severe than other storyteller incidents.</RW_storytellerBasedDifficultyInfo>

<RW_forceRandomObjectInfo>When this option is disabled, settlements will only take action within a certain radius. When this option is enabled, actions taken may be against any other object on the map. Performance may increase when random selection is enabled since no additional distance filtering occurs, but it may result in caravans or war parties traveling across the entire map. This option is only recommended if factions are clustered or separated by large distances (usually as a result of modded faction control).</RW_forceRandomObjectInfo>
